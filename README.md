In web development, routing is the process of matching a URL to a view or the set of components being rendered. In single page apps, Routing dynamically loads components and changes what's displayed in the browser as users navigate the app, all without reloading the page. React itself doesn't have
built-in routing features, so most developers rely on React Router, an external library designed specifically for React. It's the most popular solution for adding routes in React apps.

### What is Routing?
In single-page apps (SPAs), routing is responsible for loading and unloading content while matching the URL with the set of components being rendered. A good routing solution should also keep track of browser history. So user's can navigate the app using the browser's Back and Forward buttons. Routing should seamlessly link users to specific sections of your app.

One of React Router's best features is that it provides a way to share components of your app with other components via nested routes. In other words, you can nest components to build more modular, flexible and complicated web pages. In addition, nesting routes gives an easier way to visualize and establish component hierarchy.
